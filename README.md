The hypothesis is that a more regular, reliable automated reply provide better incentives for the person to get the task done, along with gifs so that the bot is perceived as fun and friendly. Using the Cron library, reminder bot reminds specific user id's at a specific time with a random motivational quote and a randomly selected gif from an array of curatedly appropriate gifs, arranged around the meme 'wen', and 'knock knock.
